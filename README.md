Got it! I'll generate a `README.md` file that follows the same format as your uploaded file but includes details from your **Angular 19 Roadmap**. Here’s your updated `README.md`:

# Angular 19 Roadmap

This project was built using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.0.

## 📌 Overview

This repository serves as a **roadmap** for mastering Angular 19. It covers **core concepts, new features, project setup, and best practices** to help you build high-performance Angular applications.

---

## 🚀 Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 📜 Roadmap

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundations (Beginner)
- **Introduction to Angular 19** – What it is, why it's popular, and key features.
- **Setting Up the Environment** – Installing **Node.js**, Angular CLI, and creating a project.
- **Understanding Standalone Components** – No more `NgModule`!
- **Data Binding & Events** – One-way, two-way binding, event handling.
- **Directives & Pipes** – `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, custom pipes.
- **Forms in Angular 19** – Template-driven vs Reactive forms.
- **Routing & Navigation** – Standalone routing, Lazy Loading.

### ⚡ Phase 2: Intermediate Level
- **State Management** – Signals, RxJS, BehaviorSubject.
- **Services & Dependency Injection** – Sharing logic across components.
- **HTTP Client & API Integration** – Fetching data, handling errors.
- **Angular Lifecycle Hooks** – `onInit()`, `onDestroy()`, etc.
- **Component Communication** – `@Input`, `@Output`, `ViewChild`.

### 🔥 Phase 3: Advanced Topics
- **Performance Optimization** – Change Detection, Lazy Loading.
- **Security Best Practices** – XSS, CSRF, JWT Authentication.
- **Unit Testing & Debugging** – Writing tests with Jest, Jasmine.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** – Making Angular apps faster.
- **Monorepo with NX** – Structuring large Angular projects.

## 🏗 Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

---

## 🎯 Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use:

```bash
ng test
```

---

## 🧪 Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## 🏛 Angular Core Concepts

Angular is built on **six main pillars**:

1️⃣ **Modules** (`@NgModule`) – Organizes the app into functional blocks.  
2️⃣ **Components** (`@Component`) – UI elements of the app.  
3️⃣ **Templates & Data Binding** – How HTML and TypeScript interact.  
4️⃣ **Directives & Pipes** – Modifying the DOM dynamically.  
5️⃣ **Services & Dependency Injection** – Sharing logic across components.  
6️⃣ **Routing** – Navigating between pages.  

---

## 🔥 What's New in Angular 19?

✅ **Fully Standalone Components** (No `NgModule` required).  
✅ **Faster Hydration & Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Improvements**.  
✅ **Improved Reactivity with Signals**.  
✅ **Built-in Control Flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`)**.  
✅ **Better Performance & Optimizations**.
